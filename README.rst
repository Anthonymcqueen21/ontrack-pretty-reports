========================
 OnTrack Pretty Reports
========================

`OnTrack Diabetes`_ is an application for the `Android operating system`_ that allows yourself to
track your glucose levels and applied medication, as well as a bunch of other useful things.

While it is an excellent application, glucose *HTML* reports are (in my humble opinion) not that
useful, as they don't allow to check how you're doing in a glance.

I would like to modify the report so that it becomes a kind of a spreadsheet, with cells colorized
according to the glucose level in blood. Sadly, as stated in the `FAQ
<http://www.gexperts.com/products/ontrack/faq.asp>`_ ::

  OnTrack is not open-source and the source code is not available, while we appreciate offers of
  assistance there are no plans to make the source code available at this time.
